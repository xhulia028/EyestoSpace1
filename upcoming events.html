                <th>Cold Atom Laboratory(CAL)</th>
                <th>A facility designed to fly aboard the International Space Station, 
                       the Cold Atom Laboratory, or CAL, will make use the space station's unique microgravity 
                         environment to observe quantum phenomena that would otherwise be undetectable from Earth.
                       The laboratory will be available for use by multiple scientific 
                           investigators and is designed to be maintained on orbit. The Cold Atom Laboratory launched 
                    successfully and was installed on the International Space Station in May 2018,serves as an experiment in the use 
                      of laser-cooled atoms for future quantum sensors.</th>

             <th>Mars 2020</th>
             <th>The Mars 2020 rover will investigate a region of Mars where the ancient environment may have been favorable for microbial life, probing the Martian rocks for evidence of past life. Throughout its investigation, it will collect samples of soil and rock, and cache them on the surface for potential return to Earth by a future mission. 
                    
                    Mars 2020 will carry an entirely new subsystem to collect and prepare Martian rocks and soil samples that includes a coring drill on its arm and a rack of sample tubes. About 30 of these sample tubes will be deposited at select locations for return on a potential future sample-retrieval mission. In laboratories on Earth, specimens from Mars could be analyzed for evidence of past life on Mars and possible health hazards for future human missions. 
                    
                    Two science instruments mounted on the rover's robotic arm will be used to search for signs of past life and determine where to collect samples by analyzing the chemical, mineral, physical and organic characteristics of Martian rocks. On the rover's mast, two science instruments will provide high-resolution imaging and three types of spectroscopy for characterizing rocks and soil from a distance, also helping to determine which rock targets to explore up close.

                <th>Euclid</th>
                <th>Euclid, a planned mission to investigate the profound cosmic mysteries of dark matter and dark energy, has passed its preliminary design review. This clears the way for construction to begin.
                        
                        Euclid is a European Space Agency mission with important contributions from NASA, including infrared detectors for one instrument and science and data analysis.
                        
                        Euclid is designed to give us important new insights into the "dark side" of the universe -- namely dark matter and dark energy, both thought to be key components of our cosmos.
                        
                        Euclid is a European Space Agency mission scheduled for launch in 2020. The Euclid consortium, with important participation from NASA, will provide science instruments and data and science analysis. NASA's Euclid Project Office is based at JPL. JPL will provide the infrared flight detectors for one of Euclid's two science instruments. NASA Goddard will perform detailed testing on flight detectors prior to delivery. The Euclid NASA Science Center is based at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC) at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. It will support all US investigators, including three teams selected by NASA. Caltech manages JPL for NASA.</p>
